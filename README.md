# [Chrome Extensions](https://github.com/muaz-khan/Chrome-Extensions)

desktopCapture/tabCapture API are used to capture content of screen or content of selected tab.

A few chrome extensions are supporting direct p2p screen steaming; whilst others are merely capturing `source-id` that web applications can use to capture relevant `MediaStream` object(s).
