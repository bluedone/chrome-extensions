2. Record Your Microphone along with Entire Screen

1.  Audio+Tab recording means voice or audio that is being played on selected tab. It can be a youtube page, an `<audio>` player or whatever. So it is NOT microphone audio; it is your tab's audio.
2. "Enable Microphone" feature works for any screen. You can enable microphone and record your own voice along with full screen or screen of any application.

#### Note

"Enable Microphone" feature requires an HTTPs page where you can click the extension icon.

You simply need to open `https://google.com` or `https://rtcxp.com` or any HTTPs page, and then click the chrome extension icon.

You need to keep above page opened during recording. You can minimize or hide above page however it MUST kept opened during recording.
