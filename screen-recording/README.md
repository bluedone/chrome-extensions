# Record Screen - Chrome Extension

[RecordRTC](https://github.com/muaz-khan/RecordRTC) is used to record entire screen or record any application screen.

Note: Audio+Tab recording will be added in next versions. It will allow you record audio along with screen!!

10 minutes should be considered max-recording limit. However this app supports more!
